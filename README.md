# TAI1.TAI2entrega
First and second assigment from the class Algorithmic Theories of Information

# First assigment

1. Develop a program, named fcm, with the aim of collecting statistical information about texts, using ﬁnite-context models. The order of the model should be a parameter passed to the program. This program should provide the entropy of the text estimated by the model.
2. Using fcm as a starting point, develop a program for automatic text generation (named generator) that, based on a ﬁnite-context model learned beforehand (using a text used as example), is able to generate text that follows that statistical model.

# Second assigment

1. Develop a program, named similarity, that accepts two ﬁles: one, with a collection of texts representing the class ri (for example, representing a certain author); the other,
1
with the text under analysis, t. Modeling should be performed using the ﬁnite-context models implemented in the previous Lab Work. Other parameters, such as the order of the context model and the parameter α of the probability estimator, should also be provided to the program. The program should report the number of bits needed to compress t using the model computed from ri.
2. As example, you should use the well-known authorship dispute on the Federalist Papers (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers). The 85 texts are available in the moodle (FedPapers.zip). Of course, you may apply your program to other authorship attribution cases that you may ﬁnd interesting..
